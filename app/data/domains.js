In the Secure Systems Group at Qualcomm, I worked on all aspects of delivering
a secure platform for Snapdragon devices.  I dealt with the entire secure-software
stack, including secure-boot, debug, hypervisor(s), the trusted
execution environment and trusted applications that ran within it. I was also
involved in managing supply-chain security, responsible open-source usage and
licensing, static analysis of the codebase, fuzzing of the system components,
code signing, continuous integration and delivery, and CVE/vulerability mitigation.
